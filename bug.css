The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it is misused, leading to unexpected results. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not work as expected if the parent element's width is not explicitly set. Another issue can arise when combining different units within `calc()`, which can lead to unexpected behavior or parsing errors.  Also, the order of operations within `calc()` should be considered carefully, as it follows standard mathematical rules.  Incorrect use can cause unexpected layout issues.
